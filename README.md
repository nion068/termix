## üöÄ Installation

Termix is available as a .NET Global Tool, which is the recommended way to install it.

### Prerequisites

You need the **[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)** or newer installed.

### Install Command

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global Termix
```

Then, you can run the application by simply typing:
```bash
termix```

#### Updating to the Latest Version
```bash
dotnet tool update --global Termix
```

#### Uninstalling
```bash
dotnet tool uninstall --global Termix
```

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: Build and Run from Source</b></summary>

If you prefer to build the project yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amrohan/termix.git
cd termix
dotnet run --configuration Release
```
</details>

## Icon Support & Fallback Mode

Termix uses **[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)** by default for pretty icons. For the best experience, it is recommended to install a Nerd Font and configure your terminal to use it.

### Running Without Icons

If you don't have a Nerd Font installed, icons may appear as `?` or `‚ñ°`. To solve this, simply run Termix with the `--no-icons` flag for a clean, universal experience:

```bash
termix --no-icons
```

This will replace glyphs with simple, text-based indicators (`[DIR]/`, `..`) that work in any terminal.
